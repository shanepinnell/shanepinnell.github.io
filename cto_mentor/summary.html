<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The California Educational Technology Professionals Association’s (CETPA) Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mentor program exists to drive the professionalism, aptitude and abilities of educational technology professionals. The CTO Mentor program achieves this by pairing the participants with highly respected EdTech professionals in a mentor/mentee relationship and by leveraging the strengths that each participant brings to the program by leveraging the power of collaboration. Additionally the program strives to highlight the increasingly important role that the CTO plays within an educational organization.</p>

<h3>Kick Off</h3>
<p>The kickoff session for the CTO Mentor Program included keynote speakers from the California Department of Education and from a consulting group that lobbies for education with the State’s Legislature. The information provided was extremely valuable and provided some great insight into the higher level workings and political pressures that education is facing in California.</p>
<p>In addition to the presentations, the CTO Mentor Program participants were provided with an overview of the course, general guidelines and the overall expectations. One of the key components of the course, reflective writing, was presented to the group and a number of exercises were done to assist the participants with being successful in writing reflections on future sessions.</p>
