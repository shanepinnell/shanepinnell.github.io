	<h4>Educational Technology</h4>
</div>
<p>
	The Educational Technology session focused primarily on the educational aspects of technology. Many of the participants in the course come from an Information Technology background and may not be aware of or have expertise in the educational aspects and requirements needed to be a successful Chief Technology Officer in an educational organization. Conversely, those participants that have come the program with a background in education may not be as well versed in the technical aspects and requirements of educational technology.
</p>
<p>
	The course covered the requirements and demands of the Common Core, including the importance of explaining the new requirements to parents and the community at large. The session also covered the relatively new assessments from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium and how it is important for every member of an educational organization to have a solid understanding of the new assessments and especially important for a CTO to understand the technical demands of successfully administering the assessments. In addition to understanding the technical demands, the session covered the importance of understanding the funding being made available to implement the new assessments and the impact that competing demands from devices, networking upgrades and professional development will have on that funding.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from the demands being imposed by the Common Core and SBAC assessments, the session also covered emerging trends in Educational Technology including concepts like Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), 1:1, online courses and how emerging technologies can be incorporated in the classroom.

	<h4>Project Management</h4>
</div>
<p>
	In the Project Management session, the candidates learned that “failing to plan is planning to fail” and that project management is “The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities“. The session covered the essential competencies required for project management and the candidates learned that the project management tool or various methodologies, while important, are not nearly as important as understanding the overall goals, scope and mission of a project, working ethically, communicating effectively, knowing available resources and sharing credit. The candidates also learned that effective project management is a vital component of a CTOs repertoire and that the successful CTO knows what their role is in the overall management of a project.
</p>
<p>
	The session covered a simplified project management lifecycle including the following steps: initiation, planning, execution and closeout as well as the inevitable “dip” in enthusiasm during a project's lifetime. The session covered each of these steps in the lifecycle and the candidates learned in particular about the necessity of properly planning for a project including risk assessment and the development of SMART goals. The session also covered the need to manage risks, resolve conflicts and how to effectively manage politics through the implementation phase of a project. Finally the candidates learned that a project can be defined and measured by three primary criteria: time, cost and quality and that these three criteria are intrinsically linked to each other whereby making a change to any one of these primary criteria will impact and affect the other two.

	<h4>Assessment and Accountability</h4>
</div>
<p>
	The Assessment and Accountability session provided candidates with a broad understanding of the current state of assessments in California and the state of uncertainty related to accountability. The candidates learned about the history of assessment and accountability and what motivated particular changes in them throughout the years. The candidates also learned about the tight relationship between assessment, curriculum and standards. The Assessment and Accountability session reviewed the California Common Core Standards and the new curriculum requirements driven by these new standards. The session also covered local assessments and the need for an educational entity to, not only, meet State and Federal requirements but to also ensure that students are college and career ready when they leave high school. Of particular import to a CTO candidate is the administration of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), formerly known as as the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) tests. The candidates discussed the trials, concerns and successes of administering the new, computer based, adaptive assessments.
</p>
<p>
	While currently an area of regulatory uncertainty, the candidates learned about the multifaceted nature of accountability including the Academic Performance Index (API) and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Being familiar with the previous iteration of accountability will better prepare the CTO candidate to incorporate the new face of assessment, whatever that may look like. Finally the candidates learned that the CTO plays in integral role in all aspects of assessment and accountability and must have a good understanding of the varied and complex nature of the same.

	<h4>Staff and Student Centered Aspects</h4>
</div>
<p>
	This session concerned itself, primarily with student and business records. The session began with understanding the regulatory environment related to properly classifying records to ensure that they are retained for the appropriate amount of time and identifying who is ultimately responsible within and educational organization for classifying and  overseeing the retention of records. The candidates learned that, irrespective of format, there are 4 major classes of records including: Continuing, Class 1 - Permanent, Class 2 - Optional and Class 3 - Other. The session covered the regulatory retention requirements of each class of record.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the classification and retention of records, the session covered the specific nuances of dealing with electronic records. The session covered the retention and discovery implications related to electronic records and what role the candidates play in making recommendations related to retention periods of electronic records. The candidates were also engaged in a number of discussions related to the variety of laws and regulations that govern access to student records and personally identifiable information including newly instituted regulations in California and the impact that they have within an educational organization. Throughout the course, an emphasis was placed on the candidate's role in maintaining the privacy and ensuring the security of student records as well as common areas where breaches may occur including the need to ensure that contractor or other third party access to records is properly reported and controlled in accordance regulation and best practices.

	<h4>Technology Policy, Standards, and Plans</h4>
</div>
<p>
	The Technology Policies, Standards and Plans session covered a variety of topics including Technology Standards, Board Policies, Education Technology Plans, Section 508 Compliance, and Copyright. The session started with a presentation on Technology Standards and why they are important. The candidates learned that typical IT standards in the workplace may no longer be effective as the consumerization of technology and the workforce's desire to have a choice over what technology they use come to the fore. Candidates also learned that as the endpoint clients become less standardized, the importance of developing and embracing standards for applications, networking and access to resources is becoming even more important than ever.
</p>
<p>
	The session also covered what Board Policies are, how they are developed, adopted and implemented. The instructors highlighted the difference between a policy and a procedure and candidates learned that the Cabinet can modify a procedure without requiring the Board's approval. The candidates also learned what a “greensheet” is and worked collaboratively to develop a greensheet for a policy change being presented to a fictitious board. The instructors covered the key requirements for a greensheet and what the board should expect to see when reading one.
</p>
<p>
	Next, the instructors covered the Education Technology Plan. The candidates learned what the purpose of an Education Technology Plan is and were presented with a variety of resources for developing and reviewing them. The session covered the five key elements of a tech plan and the candidates broke into groups to review a tech plan against the CDE's Technology Plan Template.
</p>
<p>
	The candidates also learned what Section 508 is and why it is imperative that an educational agency make a concerted effort to ensure compliance. Section 508 refers to a section in the Americans with Disabilities Act that requires that technology resources are accessible for all users. The candidates reviewed their district's websites utilizing a tool that validates Section 508 and found many shortcomings that prompted a discussion on mitigation strategies.
</p>
<p>
	Finally the instructors provided an overview of Copyright and discussed Fair Use and items in the Public Domain.

	<h4>Strategic Leadership</h4>
</div>
<p>
	The final session of the CTO Mentor program covered strategic leadership and served as a bookend for the program by reviewing the goals laid out in the first session. The candidates shared their growth over the course of the program as they worked on their individual development plans. The candidates also reviewed each of the sessions and participated in an activity highlighting the key take aways from each of the previous sessions. The instructors also covered vendor relationships and how to balance the need to maintain personal relationships with business partners while ensuring that the candidates remain true to their own ethical standards all while not running afoul of any regulatory restrictions.
</p>
<p>
	The second half of the final session started with a discussion on politics and how being in IT does not mean that the candidates are immune from or need not be savvy with regards to politics. The candidates then participated in a group activity that highlighted the need for strategic planning and how leaders can follow a process to facilitate strategic planning by adhering to a few key leadership behaviors. Finally the session covered organizational structure and goal development, including the CTOs role in defining goals for the IT department that fit within the overall organization's goals.
