<p>The kickoff session for the CTO Mentor Program included keynote speakers from the California Department of Education and from a consulting group that lobbies for education with the State's Legislature.

<p>In addition to the presentations, the CTO Mentor Program participants were provided with an overview of the course, general guidelines and the overall expectations.
