	<h4>Introduction</h4>
</div>
<p>The California Educational Technology Professionals Association's (CETPA) Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mentor program exists to drive the professionalism, aptitude and abilities of educational technology professionals. The CTO Mentor program achieves this by pairing the participants with highly respected EdTech professionals in a mentor/mentee relationship and by leveraging the strengths that each participant brings to the program by leveraging the power of collaboration. Additionally the program strives to highlight the increasingly important role that the CTO plays within an educational organization.</p>

	<h4>Kick Off</h4>
</div>
<p>The kickoff session for the CTO Mentor Program included keynote speakers from the California Department of Education and from a consulting group that lobbies for education with the State's Legislature. The information provided was extremely valuable and provided some great insight into the higher level workings and political pressures that education is facing in California.</p>
<p>In addition to the presentations, the CTO Mentor Program participants were provided with an overview of the course, general guidelines and the overall expectations. One of the key components of the course, reflective writing, was presented to the group and a number of exercises were done to assist the participants with being successful in writing reflections on future sessions.</p>
<p>The kickoff finished with an introduction to Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and an explanation of how effective they can be in education. The tenets of Reflective Dialogue, Continuous Inquiry, Collaboration and De-Privatizing Practice were explained and worked on by the CTO Mentor Program participants.</p>

	<h4>Leadership & Strategic Planning</h4>
</div>
<p>The second session of the CTO Mentor Program focused primarily on developing leadership skills and and working on strategic planning. The program participants engaged in small work groups and discussed a number of resources presented by the instructors. Finally the group worked on identifying and developing plans for individual improvement.</p>
<p>The participants viewed a number of resources that prompted a lively discussion on the various qualities of a leader. They worked in small groups discussing the merits of a variety of quotes from noted leaders and they worked on strategies for moving an organization forward.</p>
<p>Finally the CTO Mentor participants utilized a tool developed by Microsoft to develop a plan for individual improvement based on 36 competencies identified by Microsoft as paramount to the success of leaders in education. Individuals selected and collaborated on plans to focus on three of their strengths.</p>

	<h4>Professional Development</h4>
</div>
<p>The Professional Development session explained why continuous learning is vital to todayâ€™s professional. The session explained what makes for successful professional development including identifying the specific needs of the audience, tailoring the sessions to those needs and providing a feedback loop for participants. The session covered the need to develop and promote Professional Development with marketing materials that effectively explain what participants can expect to gain by attending a particular Professional Development. The Professional Development session also provided tips for presenting Professional Development successfully like the concept of ELI5 (Explain it Like I am 5) and common pitfalls to avoid like providing too much information on slides and simply reading from them.</p>
<p>
One other aspect of the Professional Development session was the discussion of the SAMR model and how we can use Professional Development to provide instruction and assistance with improving the implementation of technology in instruction, moving from Substitution through Augmentation, Modification and finally Redefinition. Of particular import was the concept of simultaneously working in all four areas of the SAMR model, using technology to enhance instruction when and where it makes the most sense.</p>

	<h4>Educational Technology</h4>
</div>
<p>
	The Educational Technology session focused primarily on the educational aspects of technology. Many of the participants in the course come from an Information Technology background and may not be aware of or have expertise in the educational aspects and requirements needed to be a successful Chief Technology Officer in an educational organization. Conversely, those participants that have come the program with a background in education may not be as well versed in the technical aspects and requirements of educational technology.
</p>
<p>
	The course covered the requirements and demands of the Common Core, including the importance of explaining the new requirements to parents and the community at large. The session also covered the relatively new assessments from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium and how it is important for every member of an educational organization to have a solid understanding of the new assessments and especially important for a CTO to understand the technical demands of successfully administering the assessments. In addition to understanding the technical demands, the session covered the importance of understanding the funding being made available to implement the new assessments and the impact that competing demands from devices, networking upgrades and professional development will have on that funding.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from the demands being imposed by the Common Core and SBAC assessments, the session also covered emerging trends in Educational Technology including concepts like Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), 1:1, online courses and how emerging technologies can be incorporated in the classroom. This session also covered the legal and regulatory requirements imposed on educational organizations implementing technology in the classroom and throughout their organization.
